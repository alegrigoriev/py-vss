# py-vss - Python framework for reading Microsoft Visual SourceSafe databases

This framework reads and parses Microsoft Visual SourceSafe (VSS) databases (repositories),
prints human-readable dump of its contents, and also produces a changelist to feed into a different source
control system.

The framework is modeled in part after Vss2Git project by Trevor Robinson at https://github.com/trevorr/vss2git.

It's written in Python, and requires Python interpreter version at least 3.9 to run. It's been tested with CPython.
